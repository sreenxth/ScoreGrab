**NOTE FOR THE TESTERS**
Hey!
This is a simple python application which uses the tkinter module to neatly display the live scores of NBA games. 

The data is provided by the amazing balldontlie.io API.

The app is designed to show all games from the current and previous day UTC (format as provided by balldontlie)

However, as the 22-23 season got over 5 months back and the 23-24 season is 23 days away, the app (scoregrab.py) will just show you a notice :/

In order to make it easy for the testers, I have created a different script which retrieve data from 25/05 to 26/10. Makes it easier for testing the app ;)

✌️
