**NOTE FOR THE TESTERS**

Hey!
This is a simple python application which uses the tkinter module to neatly display the live scores of NBA games. 

The data is provided by the amazing balldontlie.io API.

The app is designed to show all games from the current and previous day UTC (format as provided by balldontlie)
